Creating this repo for learning pyhton and making a habit by coding daily



### Day 0: 10 Nov, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Vscode setup. Refreshed memories by working on git.

**Thoughts:** Well if a YT video is of 10 mins long it will take almost triple the time to learn it. One brick at a time.

### Day 1: 11 Nov, 2021
FOrgot to update

### Day 2: 12 Nov, 2021
Continued the video. LEarnt about lists and its functions. Came to know about "tuples". Like lists but are immutable. That is once defined the values cannot be changed.
Return. When used it will return that thing whenever that function is called. IMpoertant remark

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
