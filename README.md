**Today's Progress**: Vscode setup. Refreshed memories by working on git.

**Thoughts:** Well if a YT video is of 10 mins long it will take almost triple the time to learn it. One brick at a time.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.
